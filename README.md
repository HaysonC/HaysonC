## Welcome to my GitHub

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
## [krackle](https://github.com/Epic-Eric/New-Hacks/)
I used CNN and EigenFace Difference to Detect changes in face. 
Used by a game that detect user reactions when plaing videos. 

## [Neat Pong-Bot](https://github.com/HaysonC/NEAT-PongBot/)
Using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Aumentign Topology) architecture for unsuperivised learning in
the pong game

Planning on combining other differnet deep learning architecture to start actually productive projects.

### I also worked on:
## [PHY-Pendulum](https://github.com/HaysonC/PHY180-Pendulum)
A simple object detection that detect a moving bob, by simply computing cosine differnces and finding 
contours with OpenCV

Also included analyiss software that makes the graphs and fitting for my essay, with guessing 
the centre orgin of the pendulum.

## [MapMatch](https://github.com/Epic-Eric/AWSHacks)
Using AWS services, extracts key phrases and compute sematic embeddings of personal discriptions, to
help UofT student to find roomate. We compute the differnces between the embeddign vectors and display in a 
a graphical view.
